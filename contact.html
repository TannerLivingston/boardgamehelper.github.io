                            I’ve been a resident of Salt Lake City all my life, having been born while my parents were attending the U themselves. Throughout my life, I’ve been drawn to all the classic nerdy interests, including fantasy novels, video games, and board games. As I’ve grown older I’ve gotten into the classic older nerdy interests, such as podcasts about history and more complicated board games. I first got into CS in junior high, and since then have been programming to some extent as a regular part of my life. Beyond that, other hobbies of mine include playing the bass guitar and watching speedruns of old video games. My career goal is to find a job where people focus and work hard while at work, but then are able to relax and enjoy the other aspects of life once work is over.</div>

                            Since childhood I've been a person who loves making things. In high school that meant playing french horn and trombone, acting, and building props and stages. Nowadays I get my creative escape through 3D printing, painting, and Dungeons and Dragons, but I have also found a career path that allows me to make things for work. I started programming in a class in high school and I've been hooked ever since. Since then I've become interested in a breadth of programming related topics from data science to web development. Most recently, I participated in a project trying to help students find parking on campus, and I participated in a game jam with Todd where we made Emotional Baggage. After graduation, I will be working at Lucid Software making tools very similar to what we envisioned Boardgame Helper to be, a modular application allowing users to freely design what they need for their unique situations.

                        <p class="card-text">Hi! I'm Tanner, a Computer Science major at the University of Utah. I like hiking, backpacking, mountain biking,
                            playing my guitars, piano, and video games, and spending time watching movies and playing games with my wife. I love reading and learning new things,
                            especially related to science, technology, French, and history.
                            <br>
                            I love software development, and enjoy working on all aspects of a project, from front-end to back-end.
                            I like being able to take responsibility for a feature, and seeing it through from beginning to end.
                            I'm an equally big fan of teamwork, and I like doing whatever I can to help my teams produce the greatest results possible.
                            The thing I like most about software development is how it enables me to identify needs and problems that people have,
                            and to be able to produce solutions to those problems that improve productivity and lives.

                            I love board games, movies and story telling.  One of my favourite hobbies is to look up videos on the anatomy of stories, from books to games and shows with everything in between.  I’m fascinated in how these come together and the solutions developers will find to the unique problems found in each.  In fact I’ve helped design and create a video game for a 72 hour game jam.  If you’d like to take a look there is a link above.  I also dabble in photography, rock climbing and recently picked up a hobby of making ice cream or sorbets.  Many of my friends joke about making it my day job. Yes it is that good and yes I look for excuses to share it with anyone who wants to try it.
                            When it comes to work I am most passionate about being a productive member of my team that others can rely on.  I’m not much of a competitive person and would much rather work at what needs to be done than try to outshine someone.  In other words I try to look out for my team more than I look out for myself.
                            Thank you for your time and interest in our App.  I hope you enjoy it.
